**Key Concepts:**

*   **k-means Clustering:** An algorithm for partitioning data into k clusters, where each data point belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean.
*   **Cost Function:** A function that measures the quality of a clustering, typically by summing the squared distances from each data point to its cluster's mean.
*   **Initialization:** The process of selecting the initial cluster centers, which can significantly impact the final clustering result.
*   **k-means++:** An improved initialization method for k-means that aims to select initial centers that are far apart from each other.
*   **Local Search:** A heuristic optimization method that iteratively makes small changes to a solution to improve it.
*   **Approximation Algorithm:** An algorithm that finds an approximate solution to an optimization problem, often used when finding an exact solution is computationally expensive.
*   **EM Algorithm:** A more general clustering algorithm than k-means that allows for soft clustering and non-spherical clusters.
